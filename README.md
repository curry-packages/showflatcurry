showflatcurry
=============

This package contains a tool to show a FlatCurry program
in human-readable forms, e.g., only the interface or also the
complete program translated back into pattern-based rules.

The tool is based on the library `FlatCurry.ShowIntMod`,
also contained in this package, which implemented the
operations for this tool. This library is used, e.g.,
in the Curry Browser.

In Curry REPLs, this tool is used via the command `:interface`.
